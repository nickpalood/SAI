#Every cycle at the sense step, the world generates percepts and returns to the agent a knowlegde base called the percept base.
#After this, inference is done on the union of the percept rules (this file), the agent's beliefs and the percept base.
#Every cycle your percept base changes, reflecting the current state the agent is in. 
#If you want to remember things from previous percepts, you have to build rules to do so.
#This is the purpose of the percept rules.
#Such rules typically add or delete beliefs, this is done with + and - operators.
#Add your percept rules below:


#percept agent current location
at(X) > +at(X)

#connections between the locations
passage(Y) & at(X) > +connected(X,Y)

#percept key at location
key(K) & at(X) > +atKey(X,K)

#check if door is locked
locked(K) & at(X) > +atLocked(X,K)

#percept exit at location
exit & at(X) > +atExit(X)
