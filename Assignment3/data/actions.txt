#In the act phase, the agent will try one action in the environment. 
#If the action fails, the agent will not have executed the action in the world, and the agent will go to the next cycle.
#If the action succeeds, the action rules (this file) are evaluated using inference on the union of the action rules, the beliefs and the desires.
#This is how possible postconditions are triggered. Note that you cannot form new intentions in this phase, so, world actions cannot be postconditions of actions!!!
#Add your action postcondition rules below:

#action for opening door (unlock)
open(X,K) > -atLocked(X,K) & -hasKey(K) & +notLocked(X,K)

#action for grabbing the key (add key to inventory and remove key from position)
grab(X,K) > +hasKey(K) & -atKey(X,K)

#after moving, update your location (remove old, add new)
goto(X,Y) > -at(X) & +at(Y)
